/**
 * Test Case 1: Saving a design
 * 
 * 1. User creates a wardrobe design with:
 *    - Type: walk-in
 *    - Dimensions: 300x240x300
 *    - Materials: Oak Veneer for body, Black Melamine for doors
 *    - Components: 2 shelves, 1 rail, 3 drawers
 * 
 * 2. User clicks "Save Design" button
 * 
 * 3. Expected behavior:
 *    - A JSON file is downloaded with the current configuration
 *    - The file contains all the design details including:
 *      - Wardrobe type
 *      - Dimensions
 *      - Materials
 *      - Components with their positions, dimensions, and materials
 *      - A timestamp of when it was saved

/**
 * Test Case 2: Loading a design
 * 
 * 1. User has a previously saved design JSON file
 * 
 * 2. User clicks "Load Design" button and selects the file
 * 
 * 3. Expected behavior:
 *    - The saved configuration is loaded into the application
 *    - The 3D model updates to reflect the loaded design
 *    - All components, materials, and dimensions are restored
 *    - The price is recalculated based on the loaded configuration

/**
 * Test Case 3: Loading an invalid file
 * 
 * 1. User selects a non-JSON file or a JSON file with invalid structure
 * 
 * 2. Expected behavior:
 *    - An error message is displayed
 *    - The current design remains unchanged
 */

/**
 * Test Case 4: Handling missing properties in loaded file
 * 
 * 1. User loads a JSON file that is missing some properties
 *    (e.g., missing materials or invalid component types)
 * 
 * 2. Expected behavior:
 *    - The application fills in missing values with defaults
 *    - The design loads with the valid parts of the configuration
 *    - No errors or crashes occur
